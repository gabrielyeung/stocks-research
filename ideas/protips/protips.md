- Peter Lynch: "All you need for a lifetime of successful investing is a few big winners, and the pluses from those will overwhelm the minuses from the stocks that don't work out."
- In investing, it‚Äôs 10-year returns, not daily returns. And FOMO may as well be spelled TILT.
-
```
Math is only table stakes...
To play well, it‚Äôs certainly important to know probabilities, pot odds, positional strength, and game theory.
But emotional control, playing to your strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to pay constant attention are underrated.
```
- The secret is being happy spending less than you earn.

*consider both MC and TAM*
```
People comparing market caps need to look at opportunity set too.

Don‚Äôt just buy a $5B business because it is 20x smaller than a $100B business. The bigger business might be way earlier into penetrating its TAM.

"It took me five years to learn to play the game intelligently enough to make big money." - Livermore

If you are new & you had a great year in the markets, please don't run up the ego train. Markets are very hard & there's a lot of pain you'll have to endure the first few yrs.

What a year!
A market that corrected from Feb 24 to March 19 & a once in a lifetime opportunity for those of us that have traded for multiple years!
It was forgiving, rewarded us for our discipline during a corrective phase & our indiscipline at times. Can't ask for more.
```
```
Focus on incremental personal improvement. Nobody else's performance or progress matters but your own. Look at yourself for answers and your past trades as a way to improve upon yourself. Trading is a personal journey keep it that way. Always! ü§üüëçüî•ü¶ÅüíØüôè

Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you how to position size.
Position size is based on your risk appetite, where ur in your journey, how well you‚Äôve studied the markets, emotional response to drawdowns & so many other factors

*Factor in TAM*
```
People always ask, "what's the next Tesla", and the truth is that 99.99% of companies are never going to be even close to $TSLA because the markets are too small.

As an investor, getting category potential right is just as important as choosing the right companies.

Mainstream investing discourages true deep dives into companies, preferring more shallow analysis of many companies in a diversified portfolio.
Big money has adopted this view.
That's why the deep dive skill in investing is unique and is a hack that can unlock outsized gains.

A decent starting point:
1. Read all quarterly and annual reports by company
2. Watch all interviews by management
3. Know the company's product and customers inside-out
