[How to find the next Tesla | TSLA Stock Analysis | Winning Characteristics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU8Y1fprbQw)
*Richard Moglen & RayTL@TraderLion's analysis*
- when u are studying prior market winners, what do u want to ask yourself -
  - how is this stock going to be in my ecosystem
  - does it fit into my existing process
- RayTL's winning characteristic -> **Highest Volume in over a year w/ Earnings Catalyst**
  - this is saying that institutions are interested in this stock
  - vol is showing the interest, the gap up is showing that the stock is being appreciated
- the next thing to look for is the **Follow on Follow through Volume**
  - Follow thru day's vol is greater than the earnings day volume. tells u that institutions etc are not done accumulating shares, especially when the stocks close toward the high for the day
- he has a **Gappers watchlist** that he maintains weekly based on ^^ above 2 criteria
- also on MarketSmith - he looks at `fund ownership`, likes to **increasing fund ownership, quarter after quarter**
- he likes to see where the stock closes on its earnings day, he wants the price and the action of the stock to convince him where his risk is going to be. if it goes to $1000 (or something high) it will present an obvious entry area
  - a winner is going to allow u to position in it and will give u a few opportunities if u stay on top of it
  - if it goes to $1000 without him, then it is outside of his process, dont care
- @9:10" *price pulling back on decreasing volume -> this is constructive action*
- @10" after it has done the gap up and made it onto your list - when are u shifting focus and moving it onto your focus list and looking for potential entry?
  - **Gold**  
  - if he sees the `decreasing vol + tightening price action`, can start to use that area to define his risk, at that point he knows he has the backing of the vol (from the gap up), the fund ownership increasing metric
  - also he looks at `RS days`, (what is this?!?!), which is out-performance. is $TSLA outperforming the market on down days, this is an institutional footprint, gives u more conviction
- @16:30" certain stocks will not make it out of a correction, but there are other stocks that are sort of like market pillars that will always make it out if the market makes it out of that corrective phase. (always keep track of institutional darlings, especially during a corrective phase)
  - in corrective phase, focus on names that institutions own, see how those are acting. those are the ones that will tell u, now is the time to go
- @20" he uses 21-DMA, as baseline risk + worst case scenario
  - depends on your approach and style for exiting. some will look for blow-off top signal, some want ways to hold thru corrections
  - considers 21-dma, considers portfolio point-of-view
- @22" - shows a 4yr chart view of TSLA to showcase the long base build. *really interesting price/vol chart view*
- @24" - in a good market, where institutions are positioning in on a name, u will see tight price action on the charts. in a market driven by emotion or events, u'll see action that is wide and loose
  - rational uptrend: tight closes, tight action, within the confines of an uptrend, above the 21-dma
  - leave wild action alone - hard to manage, bad for your psyche, hard to sleep at night, emotions run high
  - let the institutions start the base
  - position into a name showing rational price action. it's ok to miss a wild swing up, can still get the rational portion of the trend up
- this is year 11 for him
- @30" - where can i place my risk so that i can sleep well at night and also position in winners
- @35" - RS new high before price high -> indicator coming out of corrective phase
  - *post correction holy grail* -> `looking for RS line to make a new high before price makes a new high`
- @40:30" **Gold**
  - RS days - when market pulls back, and u see a couple of RS days
  - chart is trying to say, im trying to outperform the market, the market is holding me back. when the market resumes trend up, then the stock is unleashed to outperform
  - Relative strength 101.
  - market falls back, stock is outperforming going to say, i want to outperform but market isnt letting me. once pressure is released, stock outperforms
- @42" - the only competition u have in the market is yourself
  - consistency matters more, and u know that if u are consistent in your process and your habits and the way u approach the markets, that is going to net u returns (in the long run)
  - "trading isnt about looking good on twitter"
  - it is about having consistent habits, consistent buy rules, sell rules, and building those habits bc that will benefit u in the long term
- @45" - price queues sentiment the best
  - if price is up, everything is fine
  - if price is down, then what is that other factor to tell u are institutions piling out? or is it that the price action is wearing out traders
    - nowadays he looks for, if price is moving back, and theres a dry up in vol, just got to wait. want to see institutions pile out with confirmed volume
- @54" - **Winning characteristics summary**
  - Highest Volume in over a year w/ Earnings Catalyst
  - Follow on Follow thru Volume (especial post earnings, with high closing ranges)
  - look for dry up in vol, constructive action. RS days, Relative Strength w/ new highs before new price high
- @57:40"
  - always ask yourself where can i place my risk
  - avoid emotions in the market
  - look for tight areas
  - wait for your market conditions
  - discipline, habits, execution
  - dont be picking tops, raise stops

5/Whatâ€™s the learning? In the private markets, the focus -FIRST- is TAM (size of market), then second everything else. And the stock price is static unless there is a new round. So you have time to develop your thesis.

6/In the public markets, lots of things can affect the stock price over the short run, and one can make mistakes by overestimating data about temporary problems.

7/Patience, and confidence in the 7-10 year story (how many orders per day can Meituan generate if every urban household orders 2 meals per week...) will drive the stock so much higher than one can process during painful stock fluctuations!

9/ Conc: Imagination is the skill. Uncertainty is the opportunity. Data is important but so is the story. Patience is way underrated.
