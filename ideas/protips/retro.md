5/Whatâ€™s the learning? In the private markets, the focus -FIRST- is TAM (size of market), then second everything else. And the stock price is static unless there is a new round. So you have time to develop your thesis.

6/In the public markets, lots of things can affect the stock price over the short run, and one can make mistakes by overestimating data about temporary problems.
  
7/Patience, and confidence in the 7-10 year story (how many orders per day can Meituan generate if every urban household orders 2 meals per week...) will drive the stock so much higher than one can process during painful stock fluctuations!

9/ Conc: Imagination is the skill. Uncertainty is the opportunity. Data is important but so is the story. Patience is way underrated.
