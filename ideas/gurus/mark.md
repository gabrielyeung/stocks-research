Out of all the mistakes investors make... by far... the number one mistake that causes the biggest problems is not cutting losses. Those who don't take small losses eventually take large losses.
It's just a matter of time before you blow up.

I would never tell someone that my strategy is the best or the one they should use. It's what has worked for me. I would, however, tell them that whatever strategy they do decide to use, commit to it 100% and forget about all other strategies. This is one of my success "secrets."
