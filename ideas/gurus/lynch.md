[Tesla Stock: Investment Wisdom (Peter Lynch)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxE4-ssuqxM)
- ~1x every 2 yrs, market falls ~10%
- ~1x every 6 yrs, market falls ~25%
- behind every stock is a company, if the company does terrific over a long period of time, the stock will do terrific
- if the company does lousy, the stock will do lousy
- that is all u are betting on

- @4:25" - categories are guidelines, not hard rules
  - some companies dont fit into a category
  - some may seem to be in 2 categories at once
  - most companies change categories at some point
- @4:59" - easier to go from 100M to 200M in sales than it is to go from 10B to 20B in sales
  - smaller companies tend to have more upside potential than larger companies
  - but there are still excellent opportunities in large company stocks

- @7:07" - one way to look at growth companies is to think of baseball, 9 innings
  - buy it in the 2nd or 3rd inning, they go the formula right and still have lots of room to go

- @10:05" - your story should always include an explanation for how the company plans to improve it's earnings or to sustain it's growth rate over time
  - only 2 ways to increase earnings: increase sales or reduce costs

- @14:57" - if u believe strongly in your company story, then dont wait for ultimate buying opportunity
  - if a story is good, u prob want to own it
  - later if a buying opportunity comes along, stock falls well below its growth rate and the story hasnt changed, u can buy even more, therefore can take advantage of market declines
