**Zero emissions for home deliveries**
```
by 2025, all customer deliveries and services across 30 markets will use electric vehicles (EVs) or other zero-emission solutions.

The journey towards the zero emissions goal starts with five cities on three continents:
Amsterdam, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, and Shanghai.
And Ingka Group wants it to go even faster, so the deadline has been brought forward:
100% of IKEA deliveries in these cities will be emission-free as soon as 2020.
```
