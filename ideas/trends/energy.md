Renewable energy, mostly solar and wind, is set to account for more than two-thirds of the new electricity generation capacity that the United States will install this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday

The capacity of utility-scale battery storage is set to more than quadruple, as 4.3 GW of battery power capacity additions are scheduled to come online by the end of 2021

Battery storage will account for 11% of all U.S. planned capacity additions this year
