## Thinking in Bets - notes from Audible

### intro
- we can get better at separating outcome quality from decision quality
- thinking in bets starts with recognizing that there are exactly 2 things that determine how our lives turn out, the quality of our decisions and luck. learning to recognize the difference between the 2 is what thinking in bets is all about.

#### pete carroll & the monday morning qbs
- @3:30 -> quality of a decision vs. quality of its outcome. we have a tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome, aka "resulting". caution to resist the temptation to change your strategy based on short term results
#### 2-min warning
- @2:05" -> finding ways to execute their best intentions deliberated in advance, within the constraints of the speed expected at the (poker) table
#### I'm not sure
- @2:20" -> what makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. a great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. that state of knowledge in turn is some variation of "I'm not sure".
- @3:30" -> what good poker players and good decision makers have in common, is their comfort with the world being an uncertain and unpredictable place. they understand that they almost never know exactly how something will turn out. they embrace that uncertainty and instead of focusing on being sure, they try to figure out how unsure they are, making their best guess at the chances that different outcomes will occur. this is part of the basis of all bets.
#### Redefining Wrong
- @5:45" -> decisions are bets on the future, and they aren't right or wrong based on whether they turn out well in any particular iteration. an unwanted result doesnt make our decision wrong if we thought about the alternatives and probabilities in advance and allocated our resources accordingly.
- @6:21" -> when we think probabilistically, we are less likely to use adverse results alone as proof that we made a decision error bc we recognize the possibility that the decision might have been good but luck or incomplete information and a sample size of 1 intervened.
