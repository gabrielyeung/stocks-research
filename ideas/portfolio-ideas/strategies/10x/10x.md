Most of the investment world thinks in % annual gains.
But I think more in terms of 2x, 5x, 10x, 100x, etc.

[THIS GUY MADE 840k OFF 20k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukHgdEkY0Os)
400 GME contracts at $0.50, 20k cost, so controls 40k shares. 3 month expiration
- understand how the dynamics with the leverage and high share count
- how does one find GME in the first place though, no where close to being on my radar at the time.
- 10/2020 - 1/2021, actually GME has a good VCP shape at the time. good base to make a bet from

- another GME example but expiring this week, high risk with time
- takeaways: hmm look for and consider asymmetric risk opportunities?

Looking at $TSLA share price today, one forgets how difficult things were for the company less than 2 yrs ago.
And investing in Tesla at that point in time required a huge huge leap of faith.

Simon took that leap when price was $40. Read this thread 👇 to see how much pushback

I bought more Tesla $TSLA shares this morning, because I think we've reached peak pessimism and I would never bet long-term against Elon.

- *2600 SQ shares @ $40.9 --> 106k*
- wow, that maps to when the stock was at 18.5 B MC, in ~4/2020
- @7:39", innovation will gain market share in times of crisis
- my notes
  - F 8/14/2020 --> 10x is realistic, have seen many examples of stocks growing 10x
	- find something in the ~15-35 B MC range that u have conviction in, and put 100k on it. wait for it to 10x
  - also do the homework beforehand and have a list ready, so that when an event happens (covid-19), u are already ready to jump in on your target list. otherwise u'll be stuck reacting and needing to spend time (that u may or may not have, while also perhaps being emotionally compromised from the event) to formulate your plan
  - ~1/2021, now $222 @ 100B MC

- 100k into TSLA then 10x						
- $10,000,000 (@ $673/share) -> so that means 15k shares
