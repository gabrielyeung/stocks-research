How to find 10 baggers, 100 baggers, 1,000 baggers or 2,000 baggers?
These are the basic rules that seem to show up.
Rule 1: Buy Leaps - give yourself time to be right
Rule 2.: Stay Small - dont bet the bank. Otherwise you wont wait to sell.
Rule 3: Focus on your goal and ignore daily price action.
Rule 4: Dont panic if the stock drops. Dollar Average Down 50%.

A leap/calendar can be described as a position where you go long one leg and short another leg that expires before the long.
Let's take a look at that with my example in the next tweet.

One pair I have is:
Long $TSLA 700 x4 w/ expiration 01/21/22
Short $TSLA 900 x4 w/ expiration 01/15/21

The long position gives me exposure to 4 calls or 4x100 shares of TSLA with a strike price of $700.
This would cost me the trade price:
116.63 x 4 (calls) x 100(100 shares per call) = $46,652

I reduce this price by also going short the 900 tsla calls expiring this Jan.

This reduced the cost:
7.05 * -4(calls) * 100 (shares per call) = -$2,820
Total cost: $43,832

If $TSLA goes past $900 by January 15, I will owe 400 shares to the holder of the TSLA 900 contracts that I sold. I will cover that w/ the TSLA contracts I have with longer expiration.

I will make the difference: (900-700) * 400 = $80,000
But will lose the time value.

This trade makes the most money when TSLA continues to increase in volatility as well as in price without breaching $900 by January.

This trade loses money with decreased volatility, when time expires after the short leg expires, or with downward TSLA movement.
