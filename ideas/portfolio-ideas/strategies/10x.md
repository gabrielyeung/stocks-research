well timed option that hit
[THIS GUY MADE 840k OFF 20k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukHgdEkY0Os)
400 contracts at $0.50, 20k cost, so controls 40k shares. 3 month expiration
- understand how the dynamics with the leverage and high share count
- how does one find GME in the first place though, no where close to being on my radar at the time.
- 10/2020 - 1/2021, actually GME has a good VCP shape at the time. good base to make a bet from

- another GME example but expiring this week, high risk with time
- takeaways: hmm look for and consider asymmetric risk opportunities?

Last summer TSLA was about $40-$50 a share (accounting for split). A $136 strike is like, 200%+ increase over a year and a half to break even. Keep in mind, TSLA was dropping from near highs in late 2018.

I imagine people weren't expecting a 200% gain, let alone the 1000%+ gain that occurred.

Looking at $TSLA share price today, one forgets how difficult things were for the company less than 2 yrs ago.
And investing in Tesla at that point in time required a huge huge leap of faith.

Simon took that leap when price was $40. Read this thread ðŸ‘‡ to see how much pushback
