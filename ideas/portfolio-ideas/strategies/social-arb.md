What is “social arb” investing? Social arb investing and trading is the ability to detect change before the broader market does. We initiate investments upon discovering a meaningfully relevant social information imbalance and exit investments at the point of information parity.

When and how do you decide to exit a social arb trade? When the market researches “information parity,” and the information is fully disseminated and digested by most investors.
