What is “social arb” investing? Social arb investing and trading is the ability to detect change before the broader market does. We initiate investments upon discovering a meaningfully relevant social information imbalance and exit investments at the point of information parity.

When and how do you decide to exit a social arb trade? When the market researches “information parity,” and the information is fully disseminated and digested by most investors.

If u discover something interesting, first thing to ask yourself:
1. Does this thing have the potential to majorly impact a company, positively or negatively. If yes, next question to ask is:
2. Does the market already know about this thing. if yes, then u have no trade. but if the answer to that is no, then that means you have an arbitrage opportunity, to arbitrage the info that u surfaced. Also ask yourself
3. Is there anything else going on with this company within my trade window that might screw up my trade

[TickerTags First to Call Brexit Results Using Twitter Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tickertags-first-call-brexit-results-193758329.html)
```
When the whole world was waiting on official Brexit vote tallies out of the U.K. on Thursday, TickerTags was able to project the outcome of the vote based on social media data before the polls closed.

TickerTags monitors social media sites to identify trends by searching for words and phrases that appear together in social media content, such as tweets.

Early in the evening on Thursday, Twitter exit polling showed the vote leaning in favor of “Remain.” However, the ultimate outcome of the vote may have been decided by a late surge by the “Leave” campaign in the final hours of voting.

At 3:27 PM CDT, just minutes prior to the close of the Brexit polls, real time organinc (non-bot, non-retweeted) Twitter mentions of EU referendum-related word groupings indicated a 52/48 vote in favor of Brexit. This sample ended up being exactly in-line with the official vote results that were released hours later after a massive sell-off in futures markets.

I call myself an Information Arbitrage investor, meaning I buy a company’s stock upon discovery of an information imbalance, i.e., when I think I know something game-changing about that company that others don’t – and sell that stock when that game-changing information becomes widely accepted as fact by Wall Street.

The high concentration of city dwelling, middle-aged men who influence investment decisions on Wall Street create opportunities to profit from information imbalances that are most pronounced with respect to female, youth or rural oriented products, companies, and trends - so that is where I focus my energy. My type of investing places no value on fundamental or technical analysis. I don’t study balance sheets or PE ratios and you will never find me concerned about the quality of executive management at the companies I am invested in.

Truth is - the life of an information arbitrage investor is not all that different than that of a big wave surfer who sits through months of downtime, eyeing global weather and buoy reports while waiting for the next big swell to hit. Just as a the big wave surfer is at the mercy of nature and has to be prepared to travel to the ends of the world at a moment’s notice to seize the next big wave opportunity, the information arbitrage investor must be patient, ready and accepting of the timing and location of investment opportunities, and the manner in which they reveal themselves.

That is how I wound up standing in a line of several hundred women outside my local Target store at 8:00 AM this past September 13th. It was 256 days into the New Year and I had yet to find a new investment worth pursuing, but all that was about to change. Target was launching their much anticipated limited-edition apparel and housewares collection by Italian designer Missoni.

Many on Wall Street anticipated that the line would sell well in fashion forward cities like NY and LA but were unsure of how warmly the iconic designer’s signature zigzag design patterns would be embraced by Middle America.

It is in situations like this where the resourcefulness of an information arbitrage investor comes into play. If I were to believe the sentiment of my wife and female coworkers, or the online buzz that had been building for months among fashion and mommy bloggers then this day clearly had potential to go down as the most successful product launch in the company’s history.

Within 45 minutes of the store’s opening the fashion savvy bargain hunters had cleared out every Missoni item in the store– all 400 pieces of the collection - and a quick blog and Twitter feed check confirmed that the phenomenon I had witnessed was unfolding in towns big and small nationwide. I realized it would likely be hours, not days before the story hit the financial press, so from a lawn chair in the back of the store I pulled up my iPhone’s Scottrade app and initiated a leveraged options investment in Target’s stock . By later that afternoon and into the next morning every major media outlet from CNBC to the Today show was covering the story that would forever be known as Missoni Mayhem – and the ensuing lift in Target’s stock price provided me with a 24 hour gain of 100% on my investment.

Every real world observation you make as an information arbitrage investor is an at-bat. Each at-bat is a unique opportunity to discover an information imbalance that could lead to investing riches. But not all of your observations will qualify as genuine information arbitrage investing opportunities. Learning to become a great information arbitrage investor requires a change in the way you perceive the world around you—and the patience to wait on pins and needles for as long as it takes to put yourself in a position to capitalize on an information imbalance when it crosses your path.

In my new book "Laughing at Wall Street" I show how the average consumer with no previous financial education can outsmart Wall Street’s brightest by learning to identify game-changing information hidden in their everyday life while watching TV, reading tabloids, working at the office, shopping at the mall, eating out at restaurants, or driving the carpool to soccer practice. I am living proof that you don’t need large sums of money, fancy market data, or endless hours to achieve extraordinary wealth.
