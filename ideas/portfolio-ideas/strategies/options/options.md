- IV represents a 1 std dev change in the stock price
- 1 stddev encompasses ~68% of the occurrences around the average (the current stock price in our case)
```
1 yr, 1 stddev range formula => stock price +/- (stock price * IV)
```

-> how do u figure out what is a good option price to pay

- 2 stddev range ~95%
