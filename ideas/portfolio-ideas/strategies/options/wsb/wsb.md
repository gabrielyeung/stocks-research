[UP 116k OFF $600 ON ROBINHOOD ON GME | WSB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rozBKlSNdI)
- 98 contracts, 1/22 $60 call. cost $0.0577
- GME was at ~70 for a bit, so ~ +10. 98 * 100 * 10 = ~100k
- 1/22, GME has like a +50-80% day though, crazy
- *had to have been a deep OTM call buy, sentiment + momentum were there with GME story, but still never a guarantee to hit +50% to be breakeven. risk/reward, well played*
- *also cheaper since today is F 1/22, so 1 day call is cheaper, either it happens or it doesnt, risk a few hundred, asymmetric opportunity*

-> Id say the chance GME gaped up like today was like 1/10. If the short squeeze actually happened that would be the expected outcome. Thats why you don't sell retarded options on something that could explode like that.
-> How were you suppose to know short squeeze was suppose to happen today at this magnitude.
-> You don’t. But it’s very clear it’s imminent, and weekly calls at this point are not stupid

Yeah the more I think about it, the more genius OP looks for gambling on this. If you believe in the big GME short squeeze, and see it as somewhat likely to occur near options expiry dates, why not sling a few hundred bucks on last-minute OTM options Friday morning?

why not? prob because there's an intensely high chance of failure and its a waste of money. this is dumb luck at it's finest no matter how much you believe in the short squeeze. short squeezes still have days of flat trading if there aren't enough buyers on those days and the short really believe it can come back down.

Genius level play when it works, 10 IQ move when it doesnt

500 bucks. Literally rolling the dice. You wouldn't bet a significant amount of capital on this play

- *$54C @ $0.01, @9:31am

Don’t beat yourself up.
99% of the time you make a bet like that you lose your bet. That’s why those options were so cheap this morning.

Last summer TSLA was about $40-$50 a share (accounting for split). A $136 strike is like, 200%+ increase over a year and a half to break even. Keep in mind, TSLA was dropping from near highs in late 2018.

I imagine people weren't expecting a 200% gain, let alone the 1000%+ gain that occurred.

bought deep OTM when stock was $220 presplit ($44 post-split), cost was 0.23 per post split share. --> so probably bought ~June 2019, ~6/21/2019

"basically TSLA was left for dead. These contracts were ~$5 ($1 post split) just a few months before when the stock was $300 ($60 post split) stock was down around $40-45 when i bought these and sentiment was low. i was thinking worst case the stock gets back to $60 and i make 4-5x. i'm also a long term TSLA share holder, had 200 shares at the time. so had strong conviction TSLA stock would go up in medium term"

- $460 cost -> 1M
- @7:49" -> 20 contracts 1/15/21 $136 strike, cost 0.23$ post split. (bought 4 tsla calls presplit)
*"stock (sentiment) was low and personal conviction was high"*
```
Nice. When did you buy those calls?
Summer 2019. Had just driven model S for first time so stock was low and personal conviction was high.
I’ve also owned common stock since 2014.
```
- summer 2019 tsla was ~$60 with MC ~55B. ^^ strike at $136 would already have been a double
