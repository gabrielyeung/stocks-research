It’s not about the money.
The goal should always be about the freedom to do anything with your life that you want and the impact that you can have on others.
Don’t make your “why” about the money because that leads to burn out

Learnings from letters over the years by Buffett, Oaktree, and Third Point - and my own investing career.
Thread below 👇

Howard Marks at Oaktree has a letter out today - where he writes about this “False Dichotomy of Value and Growth”.
Worth a read and highly recommend.
He mentions that Buffett has famously said "we don't consider ourselves to be value investors".
