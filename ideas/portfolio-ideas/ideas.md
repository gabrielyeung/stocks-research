Since I get lots of DM's asking about my current portfolio and what I own, I decided to create a Google spreadsheet and make it viewable for everyone. My plan is to update it every afternoon after the market closes.

(Thread) Why do I own individual stocks?

Thesis:

1. The digitalization of our world is 10% complete.
2. This megatrend will continue for at least another decade.
3. If you enjoy spending your free time on individual stocks, then the potential for outsized returns is possible.

I invest in companies that can
1. successfully disrupt an industry with new business models $TTD $SQ $PTON $TDOC
2. further enable the digital transformation with their services and infrastructure $ZS $HUBS $TWLO $CRWD
