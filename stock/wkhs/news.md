Now this is where things get thorny. Let's take a look at our remaining three vendors at this point:
Karsan (Turkey) + Morgan Olson (US - made 6.5k USPS trucks from 2015-175) - Plug-in Hybrid
Oshkosh (US) + Ford (US) - Internal Combustion
Workhorse (US) + Lordstown Motors (US) - Electric

So the six-billion-dollar question is this: does USPS say, hey, cool this makes our decision for us and award the contract to WKHS? Or do they say hey EV wasn't part of the original specs so we're going to give the remaining vendors an opportunity to revise their prototypes to be compliant with the new conditions (see Oshkosh & Ford joining forces with Microvast $THCB, or Ford's Preexisting Partnership with Lightning eMotors $GIK)?

```
(i) When the relative importance of price is more important than the other evaluation factors, 6 percent is added to the proposed price of the non-qualifying end product and this adjusted price is used for evaluation; and

(ii) An end product qualifies as manufactured in the United States if the cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components, similar to domestic content requirements under the Buy American Laws.

The Postal Service told Trucks.com that it expects to reach a contract with one or more of the teams bidding for the business in the federal governmentâ€™s second fiscal quarter of 2021.
That works out to the first quarter of next year.
