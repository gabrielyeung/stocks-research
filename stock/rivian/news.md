Rivian may soon close on a funding round worth several billion dollars that could give it a $25 billion valuation

All that funding, plus an operational production facility in Normal, Illinois make Rivian one of the most promising challengers to Tesla in the EV space.

The "Launch-Edition" models of the firm's R1T pickup and R1S SUV are due out this summer, with base models following in 2022. The company is also developing a fleet of 100,000 battery-powered delivery vans for Amazon, which are set to start hitting the road come 2022.
