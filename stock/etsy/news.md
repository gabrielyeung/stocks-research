69 million people have bought something on Etsy in the last year,
and the platform has been adding 1 million new buyers each week

Etsy has a three-pronged fee structure: there’s a $0.20 listing fee (listings are active for four months, or until they sell). There’s also a 5% transaction fee and 3% + $0.25 payment processing fee for every item purchased. And earlier this year, the company added a 15% offsite ads fee, which only charges sellers if they make a sale through offsite ads.
