Pinterest launches Shopify partnership

The number of Pinners who have engaged with shoppable Product Pins has increased 44% year-over-year,
and total traffic to retailers has increased by 2.3x year-over-year.
And, due in part to early beta testing with Shopify, catalog feed uploads increased 144% in the first quarter of the year.

Shopify merchants in the U.S. and Canada are now able to share their products to about 350 million Pinterest users, the companies announced Thursday.
