## Product Highlights
1. battery swap -> (6 free battery swaps a month). solution makes sense for population-dense cities in China. (most ppl live in apts and dont have access to at-home charger)
2. BaaS, rent the battery -> subscription revenue model
3. nio house community -> used to grow nio community
4. nomi -> neat siri/alexa-like tool
5. luxurious interior -> product branding/what they want to be known for
6. nio store/ ecom (fulfilled by JD)/ nio points -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evjLan1XbKY

- china cities are population dense
- people live in apartments
- not everyone can install home chargers
- charge station experience not smooth, (drive to charge station then have to wait in line then wait for battery to charge)
- with battery swap solution, can instead schedule a battery swap time, dont have to wait in line, dont have to wait for battery to charge

Thank you for sharing your thoughts for choosing Nio and EC6. I own a Tesla Model Y and absolutely love it. But I would definitely consider a Nio if it was available in the USA, the luxury is just not there in the Model Y. You have some valid points but in my opinion your #5 should be #1. My thoughts on your other reasons.

For reasons #1 and #2, there are some great benefits for the Chinese market and agree with them. However, it's different for USA and Tesla started battery swapping but no one used it. Also Tesla's plan to integrate the battery into the car chassie will be ultimately be a bigger benefit than battery swapping. So it's a good thing Nio is doing in China and better than tesla in this current time but I think Tesla will end up having the most benefit in the long run.

 For #3, I love this idea and potentially a great money making opportunities for Nio with advertising, selling accessories and keeping their customers engaged and encouraging social gathering. Tesla should copy this for USA.

For #4, as you stated, it's a minor reason. You may not be aware but Tesla has voice commands and works very well with current state. Can do most of the things you mentioned for Nomi. I can ask it to control AC, make calls, navigate and much more. But I like the idea of Nomi and hands free activation which I hope Tesla will enable later.


Mr. P:
-> Every nio car owner gets 6 free battery swaps a month
-> Baas, is where you rent the battery instead of buying it, so you reduce and save on the battery purchase price upfront around 80k rmb, and you just pay a monthly fee

-> baas is operated under a joint venture with catl, so used batteries will be recycled, they get monthly payments for ever,
