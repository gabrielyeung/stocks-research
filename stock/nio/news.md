[NIO Early Adopter (Car #885) - Interview w/ NIO Founder's Edition Owner ËîöÊù•Ê±ΩËΩ¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv1guDEl86M)
- Nomi voice experience better than TSLA bc the Nomi software developed in china, easier to understand the language
- Nio understands the chinese culture
- Nio wants to create a life ecosystem, take care of every aspect of your life, has clothing brand, ecom with JD, etc
- likes battery swap approach bc after 5 yr, might have battery degrade issues, but can swap out. Also battery technology keeps improving, so can switch to better battery packs
