When was the last time you saw so many people in a showroom to see consumer product? With no paid advertising, people showed up in droves even before the demo vehicle was properly parked. With overwhelming enthusiasm, MIC Model Y will be a hit to ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ legacy auto makers.

Seen in my WeChat group: Land Rovers owners are ditching their Land Rovers for MIC Model Ys. Model 3 offers no attraction to these big SUV lovers but they canâ€™t resist the temptation of Model Y due to value and practicalities.

*FSD revenue model*
```
Tesla makes $10,000 on FSD by somebody saying yes I want that.  Software delivered immediately.  No UPS or FedEx or postal service in the way.  Aapl, iTunes.  Facebook, ads.  Google ads + play store.  Adobe, subscription service.  Point being, cash cows sell digital goods.

```
Both Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy and Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives think the electric-car maker is likely to report fourth-quarter deliveries high enough to meet Tesla's guidance for 500,000 deliveries this year -- a figure that is up from about 368,000 deliveries in 2019.

Levy thinks Tesla will deliver about 183,000 vehicles in Q4. Highlighting how significant this would be, it would represent 31% sequential growth and 63% growth over deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2019.

**Tokyo 2030 EV plans**
```
Tokyo has set a goal for all new cars sold in the city to be hybrids or electric vehicles by 2030, Gov. Yuriko Koike said in a meeting of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly on Tuesday, declaring that the onus is on the world's major cities to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

"We are going to be 100% non-gasoline and lead the global trend," Koike stressed.

Separately, the government of Japan is looking to set a goal of ending sales of gasoline only fueled cars by the mid-2030s.

Tokyo's goal puts it five years ahead of the national plans as the city aims to lead the way in promoting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Tokyo will "request" that automobile manufacturers comply with its policy, rather than implement regulations to enforce it. There will be no penalties, but companies are likely to try to meet the city's goals, knowing that their reputation is at stake.

**S&P 500 inclusion**
```
On November 16, 2020, S&P DJI announced that TSLA will be added to the S&P 500 effective prior to
the open of trading on Monday, December 21 to coincide with the December quarterly rebalancing
effective date. Due to the large size of the addition, S&P DJI is seeking feedback on whether to add the
stock at:
1) The full float-adjusted market capitalization (FMC) weight all at once, effective prior to the open
of trading on Monday, December 21, or
2) In two tranches, with the first tranche added one week earlier (effective prior to the open on
Monday, December 14), and the second tranche added effective on the rebalancing effective
date.
```
