On November 16, 2020, S&P DJI announced that TSLA will be added to the S&P 500 effective prior to
the open of trading on Monday, December 21 to coincide with the December quarterly rebalancing
effective date. Due to the large size of the addition, S&P DJI is seeking feedback on whether to add the
stock at:
1) The full float-adjusted market capitalization (FMC) weight all at once, effective prior to the open
of trading on Monday, December 21, or
2) In two tranches, with the first tranche added one week earlier (effective prior to the open on
Monday, December 14), and the second tranche added effective on the rebalancing effective
date.
