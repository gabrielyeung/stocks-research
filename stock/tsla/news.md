**Tokyo 2030 EV plans**
```
Tokyo has set a goal for all new cars sold in the city to be hybrids or electric vehicles by 2030, Gov. Yuriko Koike said in a meeting of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly on Tuesday, declaring that the onus is on the world's major cities to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

"We are going to be 100% non-gasoline and lead the global trend," Koike stressed.

Separately, the government of Japan is looking to set a goal of ending sales of gasoline only fueled cars by the mid-2030s.

Tokyo's goal puts it five years ahead of the national plans as the city aims to lead the way in promoting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Tokyo will "request" that automobile manufacturers comply with its policy, rather than implement regulations to enforce it. There will be no penalties, but companies are likely to try to meet the city's goals, knowing that their reputation is at stake.

**S&P 500 inclusion**
```
On November 16, 2020, S&P DJI announced that TSLA will be added to the S&P 500 effective prior to
the open of trading on Monday, December 21 to coincide with the December quarterly rebalancing
effective date. Due to the large size of the addition, S&P DJI is seeking feedback on whether to add the
stock at:
1) The full float-adjusted market capitalization (FMC) weight all at once, effective prior to the open
of trading on Monday, December 21, or
2) In two tranches, with the first tranche added one week earlier (effective prior to the open on
Monday, December 14), and the second tranche added effective on the rebalancing effective
date.
```
