- Q4 earnings release yesterday, today up 17%
- felt like I missed the connection that subscription price hike may be well liked by wallstreet during future earnings report
- 11/29/2020 email from NFLX saying "We’re updating our prices to bring you more great entertainment. Your monthly price will increase by $1 to $13.99 on December 29, 2020."

- “Importantly, while Netflix beat subscriber expectations in all major territories, Netflix’s most mature market U.S./Canada reported materially better than expected nearly +900K net new subscribers (vs. our +375K expectation) which highlights that the ultimate penetration for NFLX services globally could be higher than anticipated,” pointed out Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak.

The company flat out hit the earnings day trifecta of bullish indicators.

1) Netflix guided to a first quarter operating margin of 25%. That would be a meaningful step up from the already impressive 14.4% rate in the fourth quarter. Netflix’s highest operating margin of 2020 came in the second quarter at 22.1%. The read for Wall Street: as expected, the combination of a materially higher base of subscribers paying more for a service is leading to stronger profits.
2) “we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.” The company also raised its cash flow guidance for 2021 by $1 billion to breakeven. Considering Netflix’s business model has long required debt to operate, this improved free cash flow outlook is being embraced by the bulls.
3) Netflix signaled it may resume stock buybacks soon, as it did from time to time from 2007 to 2011.

“While the 4Q sub beat will garner most of the attention, we believe
- the improved free cash flow commentary and
- future capital independence
is the more important positive takeaway."

keep this in mind for future growth companies
1. blowout quarter
2. FCF inflection point to breakeven or positive
3. + a bullish kicker such as stock buybacks
