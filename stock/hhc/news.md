[BILL ACKMAN THINKS THIS STOCK WILL EXPLODE - Spent $200 Million This Month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNYz-cs42k)
- how did he know ackman bought this?
- real estate play into emerging market makes sense, ie Texas, Vegas etc
- also low interest rate
- what does he mean IV ~33% is low? is that a good IV to look for?
