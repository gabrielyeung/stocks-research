Its revenue jumped 32 percent to $4.8 billion in 2019, but it reported a net loss of $674 million that year.
The company also lost money in 2018 and 2017.

This year, Airbnb said, revenue fell 32 percent to $2.5 billion in the first nine months as travelers canceled their plans after the pandemic crippled travel and forced lockdowns around the world.

Airbnb said it currently has 7.4 million listings run by 4 million hosts worldwide. Eighty-six percent of its hosts are outside the U.S. and 55 percent are women, the company said.

The company said it had 54 million guests in 2019.

Chesky, Airbnbâ€™s CEO, will receive a multi-year equity grant worth an estimated $120 million in lieu of a salary, the company said. The award will vest if he meets stock-price targets over the next decade.
