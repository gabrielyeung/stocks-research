see the xlsx file [./Airbnb-Model-v3.xlsx]

## business model
- travel platform
- increase gross bookings, take ~12-15% cut from host + travelers
- increase users
- `Our Long-Term Growth Strategy` S1 page 221

## risks  
- continuing covid-19 headwinds, travel cancellations. see S1, page 40-44
- `Our revenue growth rate has slowed, and we expect it to continue to slow in the future`. S1, page 47
- not profitable yet
```
from S1, page 27 -
We have incurred net losses in each year since inception, and we may not be able to achieve profitability. We incurred net losses of $70.0 million, $16.9 million, $674.3 million, and $696.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020, respectively.
```
- stock-based compensation window opens
```
At the time of the offering, we expect to recognize stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 billion for which the service-based vesting condition was satisfied or partially satisfied as of November 25, 2020 and for which we expect the liquidity-based vesting condition to be satisfied in connection with this offering.
```
- laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws
- Home sharing may not achieve global acceptance. S1, page 60.
- brand trust could erode. via host or guest misconduct, party houses etc. S1, page 60.
```
Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our growth, and negative publicity could damage our brand and thereby harm our ability to compete effectively, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

## what i like about airbnb
- founder led company with strong vision, hospitality, and care for others
- founder's comp is tied to stock price growth, via 10 tranches. S1 page 313
- when faced with trimming workforce early 2020, with covid looming and pre-ipo, management awarded generous severance packages to employees
- industry disrupter to travel sector
  - expedia bought VRBO/homeaway to hedge against Airbnb
- airbnb offers unique 1-off travel experiences: castles, wine vineyards etc.
- cost of airbnb can be substantially less vs a hotel room, (note. but also no hotel staff around to help out, airbnb could also be less clean if not properly cleaned by host)
- airbnb can scale globally faster than a hotel chain since they are a platform. they also dont have to pay real estate costs
- the amount paid to airbnb by host/guest is substantial, 12-15%. if a property rents for $3k a month, $36k/year, airbnb takes $3-4k of that as platform fees

## stock's story
- follow as a growth story, not profitable yet. look for growth stat increases instead of eps
- see how covid/travel impacts revenue #'s and investor sentiment
- see how covid vaccine plays out going into next year spring travel season
- follow tsa travel flight numbers
- a lot of pent up travel demand will release once this pandemic passes
- factor in that it's a ~13 yr company, and employees can finally sell shares

## misc
