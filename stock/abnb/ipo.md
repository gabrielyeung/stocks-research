Airbnb intends to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ABNB. Helming the deal are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, among others. The vacation rental platform plans to raise $3 billion from its offering, potentially valuing the company above the $30 billion mark.

No news yet of how many shares will be available or at what price. But Airbnb did mention in its prospectus that it plans to set aside up to 9.2 million shares of non-voting stock for Airbnb hosts.
