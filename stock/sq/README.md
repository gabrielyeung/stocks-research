## overview
```
Economic Empowerment
We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy—so we’re building easy tools to empower and enrich everyone.
Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run, and grow their business. We combine sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile and computing devices into powerful payment and point-of-sale solutions.
Our tools help sellers make informed business decisions through the use of analytics and reporting.
Sellers can manage orders, inventory, locations, and employees; engage customers and grow their sales; and gain access to business loans.
Our approach is the same with Cash App: we see an opportunity to build a similar ecosystem of services for individuals, providing financial access to all and allowing anyone to send, spend, and save money all from one app.
It all aligns with our purpose of economic empowerment—we are helping all kinds of people succeed and grow in the economy.
