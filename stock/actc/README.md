Metro has committed to move to a 100% zero-emissions fleet powered by renewable energy no later than 2040.

In 2018, Metro began leasing 10 battery-electric buses from three manufacturers for testing during 2019-2020.
  - two 40' buses from Proterra, two 40’ and
  - two articulated 60’ buses from New Flyer, and
  - two 40’ and two articulated 60' buses from BYD

Timeline:
- 2020: orders 120 battery buses
- 2025: adds up to 250 more battery buses

King County Metro announces agreement to purchase 40 battery-electric buses and plans to purchase 80 more from New Flyer of America, Inc. in the coming year for a total estimated cost of $130 million.
This fleet order is Metro’s first big step in responding to the climate crisis in accordance with the county’s Strategic Climate Action Plan.
