# My Framework Approach

So these are the tips that have helped me, let me know what protips have helped u all too -
 First thing, many strategies out there, everyone has to find the one or ones that fit their own style/personality/ risk tolerance. Each strategy will have its own pro’s/con’s and lend itself toward a particular emotional experience. Key i've found is to think thru the pro's/con's of each strategy, and layer a few together to create a composite framework that fits you. (ie. listen/read a lot abt what has worked for other ppl, then retrospect and try a few times to figure out what works for you)

## My stock strategies are
- Prepare emotional mindset. There will be fomo, and excitement, have to make sure your actions/position sizes are rational and that risk/reward ratios are balanced
- Cut loss quickly. 7% down means u need 8% gain to recover, whereas 50% down means u need 100% gain to breakeven. (Don’t pretend paper loss isn’t a loss and hold, cut it and move on to next opportunity, time is more valuable)
- In general, approach an entry with a 2:1 reward/risk factor, up to 7% downside. ie. 15% reward/7% risk. Identify the floor resistance of the chart setup to estimate the downside support levels. This gives u a framework to tread water while u wait for a homerun, can lose 2x for every winner. Track profit factor to understand if your framework is scalable -> how much u win when u win * how often u win / (how much u lose when u lose * how often u lose)
- Know your entry/exit plan and approach before you enter. Otherwise in a sharp sudden drawdown, u will be emotionally compromised and make a poor decision.
- Process over profits. Practice executing your framework and refining your strategy to grow an approach that you are confident can scale up. Sometimes we take a good shot but miss, sometimes we take a bad shot but make it, overtime the % for a good shot will shine thru, develop and trust your practice. Especially as your investing size scales up, have to trim out your bad habits while your portfolio is still small, don’t want to be taking a bad-habit shot with a 100k - 1M position size.
- Understand rule of 72, and shoot for 26% returns, meaning 72/26 = 3, will take 3 years to double. Aim for the stars so that u fall in the clouds. Shoot for companies with 10x potential, so that u can fall to 26% gain, min 15%
- Understand relationship with supply/demand, share float, MC, price/volume, and the psychology implied in the chart. Look for support/resistance. Advanced, factor in short ratio, for short squeeze potential.
- Layer in some small consistent winners, to afford the risk to look for a homerun hitter. Megacaps are good candidates for a slow consistent wins. Factor in your current profit factor when you decide to take winners. Don’t hold for a year just for the sake of long term tax rate, when the chart says to sell, sell. Time and opportunity cost are more valuable than saving money. Also, compounding a small win repeatedly and quickly over the course of a year will offer a chance of adding up
- Aim for 5-10x growth companies in technology related sector, with MC’s in 2-100 B range. Approach larger MC, but factor in their ceilings. Track their charts, understand their story, and what their catalysts are
- For short term trading, layer in technical charting strategies ontop of companies that you have conviction in.
- If you want to apply several strategies, setup separate accounts for each strategy. this helps frame your mindset for each account. ie. “Long term hold, don’t touch” acct, short term trading account, etc
- For long term holds, 3-10+ yr, I’ll deep dive until I thoroughly understand the company and what I’m investing into, then position size in based on risk tolerance floor/ceiling + time horizon for that company.
- For short term holds, 2-12 wks, I’ll wait for a base to form in the graph use that as my floor point, wait for price and volume to settle and become tight, then buy in with ^^ 2:1 risk factor with stop-loss. I see this point as the point of least resistance to take off should it take off. Confirmation signal should follow soon, if wrong, cut loss quickly and move on, circle back in a week or two to check chart sentiment, see if it sets up again. If correct, track stop loss point and move up stop loss until break-even. If up 20%+ shouldn’t ever have to exit at <0%, trim winners according to profit factor
- Quarterly, or at least annually, retrospect my trades, focus on improving process over improving profits. figure out the good and the bad based on the trade plan going into and out of the trade, use that data to tweak my framework going forward
- advanced strat - have to understand options thoroughly before trying. To generate cashflow, only for companies that you would want to own anyways, sell puts

## Other strategies (ordered from conservative to more aggressive)
- *Index investing*, slow and steady. Historically averages 10% - Pro: works great if u have a ton of principle already and want totally hands off. Con: 10% means takes 7 years to double. To me, SPY/QQQ is like buying in to the full set of NBA/NFL playoff teams, (yet the NFC East leader (phi/dal/nyg/was) will make the playoffs too, but their chance to win Super Bowl is slim.)
- *Fundamental/Value* investing/buffet, slow and steady - this works great if u have a ton of principle already such that 10-15% of that is a lot, or if you have a ton of time and can wait, 30+ years for it to compound. Otherwise, 15% annual gain means, it takes ~5 years to double, in 30yrs, that would be 6 doubles, but depending on initial principal size, it is really the last ~2 doubles where u’ll get the most gross growth, so the first ~20 years will still feel like hard work. NBA comparison: Spurs, well run and well coached, consistent dividends
- *Sector ETF* - if you know a sector is hot but don’t know which company within the sector is the hottest or don’t want to do the homework, sector etf is a great choice. ie. (NFC East (dal/philly/giants/was) is weak, NFC West (lar/sea/ari/sfo) relatively well rounded)
- *Managed ETF* - currently the managed funds that I’ve looked into that have great management are the Barron funds and the ARK funds. Pro: well managed, good gains, gives you a nice hands off no homework approach with better returns than broad index 20%+, Cons: management fees + they have capital allocation rules to manage risk etc, both a good and bad thing. But means you lose the ability to fine tune how you would like to handle a situation should your perspectives ever differ. ie. Let a winner run, vs sometimes funds cap position size at 10%, or trim X to manage overall fund drawdown, etc.
- *Growth* - companies that are hitting high growth metrics, but sometimes not profitable yet. if not profitable yet, will be prone to swing based on news catalyst. Deep dive to find conviction in a company first, then position size in based on risk tolerance
- *Options* - understand time decay and implied volatility - find conviction on a stock’s direction first, and then this can be used as a tool to increase leverage or to increase cash flow by selling.
- *Futures/Forex* - not in my repertoire currently
