The semiconductor space has witnessed strong growth so far this year.
Notably, the broader iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) is up 47.8% compared with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF's (SPY) rally of 13.3% year to date.

Microchip demand is also likely to get a boost with the 5G boom in Europe and parts of Asia, including China and Singapore.
IDC expects 5G smartphone shipments to grow to 58% in 2024 from 19% of global volume in 2020, which should act as a tailwind for the semiconductor market.
